The document **"Teckshama.docx"** is a **project report** on an **AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System**. It was submitted as part of an **AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning** under **TechSaksham**, a **joint CSR initiative by Microsoft & SAP**.

---

## **Key Highlights of the Report:**

### **1. Problem Statement:**
- Manual resume screening is **time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human bias**.
- Recruiters scan resumes for only a few seconds, leading to **overlooking qualified candidates**.
- **Traditional ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)** rely on **keyword-based filtering**, which often rejects strong candidates due to missing keywords.
- The goal is to use **AI-powered automation** for **fair, unbiased, and accurate hiring**.

---

### **2. Objectives:**
- Develop an **AI system** to automate resume screening.
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze and rank candidates.
- **Reduce hiring time** and **eliminate unconscious bias** in the selection process.
- Ensure **scalability and adaptability** across different industries.

---

### **3. Literature Survey:**
The report discusses **existing methods** and their limitations:
1. **Traditional ATS** - Uses **keyword-based filtering**, which is **ineffective**.
2. **NLP-based Resume Parsing** - Uses **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **word embeddings**.
3. **Machine Learning for Resume Ranking** - Uses **supervised learning models like SVM and Random Forest**.
4. **Bias in AI-powered Hiring** - AI models **inherit biases** from historical data.
5. **Industry Implementations** - Companies like **LinkedIn, IBM Watson, and HireVue** use AI in hiring.

---

### **4. Proposed AI-Based System:**
- **Workflow:**
  1. **Data Preprocessing** - Extracting text from resumes (PDF, DOC).
  2. **Feature Extraction** - Using **TF-IDF** and **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling.
  3. **Resume Ranking** - Assigning a score based on **skills and job relevance**.
  4. **Web Interface** - Recruiters can **input job descriptions and upload resumes**.
  5. **Final Ranking** - The system **orders resumes based on similarity scores**.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **NLP Models:** BERT, Word2Vec, TF-IDF.
  - **Machine Learning:** SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
  - **Deep Learning:** LSTM, Transformers.

---

### **5. Implementation and Results:**
- The system allows **job description input and resume upload**.
- **Resumes are ranked** based on **similarity scores**.
- **Higher-scoring resumes are prioritized** for recruiters.
- **GitHub Links** to code repositories are provided.

---

### **6. Future Work:**
- Expand system capabilities to **other languages** (German, French, Hindi).
- Enhance **real-time feedback integration**.
- **Improve bias mitigation** techniques.

---

### **7. Conclusion:**
- The AI-powered system **reduces manual work**, **increases efficiency**, and **eliminates bias**.
- The **Web UI** enables recruiters to screen resumes **intelligently**.
- Future improvements could **enhance accuracy and fairness** further.
